First event and last event from DVS stream used for the sequences:

TODO: Right now, this is how it is done because we know exactly when the platform starts moving. 
In the future we should use a synchronization tool between the DAVIS and the KINECT (they have also different frame rates: DAVIS 20 fps, KINECT 9 - 30 fps).
